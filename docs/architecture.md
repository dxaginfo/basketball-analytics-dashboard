# Basketball Analytics Dashboard - Architecture

## Architecture Overview

The Basketball Analytics Dashboard follows a modern React application architecture with modular components, TypeScript for type safety, and a thoughtful state management approach.

```

## Layer Details

### UI Layer

- **Views**: Container components for each page (Dashboard, Team Analysis, Player Analysis, etc.)
- **Widgets**: Reusable visualization components (charts, tables, shot charts, etc.)

### Data Layer

- **Store**: Redux store with slices for different data domains
- **Services**: API interaction, data transformation, and external services integration

## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**: User interacts with the UI
2. **Action Dispatched**: UI component dispatches an action
3. **Store Update**: Reducers process the action and update state
4. **UI Updates**: Components connected to the store re-render

## Folder Structure

```
/src
  /assets        # Static assets like images, fonts, etc.
  /components    # Reusable UI components
    /charts      # Chart components
    /layout      # Layout components
    /ui          # Basic UI elements
  /features      # Feature-based modules
    /dashboard   # Dashboard feature
    /teamAnalysis # Team analysis feature
    /playerStats # Player statistics feature
  /hooks         # Custom React hooks
  /services      # API and external services
  /store         # Redux store setup
    /slices      # Redux slices for each domain
  /types         # TypeScript type definitions
  /utils         # Utility functions
```

## Technology Choices

- **React**: UI library
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and developer experience
- **Redux Toolkit**: State management with modern Redux patterns
- **D3.js**: Low-level visualization library
- **Recharts**: React charting library built on D3
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Chakra UI**: Accessible component library

## Data Model

The core data model includes:

- **Teams**: Team information and aggregate statistics
- **Players**: Player profiles and statistics
- **Games**: Game results and detailed statistics
- **Lineups**: Different player combinations and their performance
- **Shots**: Shot location and result data

## Optimization Strategies

- **Code Splitting**: Lazy load routes and heavy components
- **Memoization**: Use React.memo and selectors to prevent unnecessary renders
- **Virtualization**: Implement virtualized lists for large datasets
- **Service Workers**: Cache assets and API responses for offline capability
- **Bundle Optimization**: Tree shaking and chunk optimization
