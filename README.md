## 📊 Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with:

- **Component-Based Design**: Reusable, isolated components
- **Container/Presenter Pattern**: Separation of data handling and presentation
- **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulated, reusable logic
- **Context API**: For global state that doesn't warrant Redux
- **Service Layer**: API communication abstracted from components

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16.x or higher
- npm 8.x or higher

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dxaginfo/basketball-analytics-dashboard.git

## 📚 API Integration

The dashboard integrates with multiple basketball data sources:

- **Game Statistics API**: For historical and real-time game data
- **Player Information API**: For player profiles and career statistics
- **Team Records API**: For team standings and historical performance

## 🔄 Data Flow

1. **Data Fetching**: API requests are made through service layer
2. **State Management**: Data is stored in Redux with appropriate normalization
3. **Selector Functions**: Components access data through memoized selectors
4. **Rendering**: Visualizations and components update reactively
5. **User Interaction**: Actions dispatch state updates, triggering re-renders

## 📱 Responsive Design

The dashboard is designed to work seamlessly across:
- Desktop monitors
- Tablets
- Mobile devices

## 🔒 Security
